### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2019

+ Projec title: Why Jazz become less common nowadays?
+ This project is conducted by [Xin Gao]

+ Project summary: After reading report from website, I noticed that jazz has become the least-listen to music in the U.S..I try to figure out possible rasons for that in this project. I did some fundatmental analysis, such as tracking the proportion changes of each genre,sentiment analysis on jazz and hip-hop music, change of word usage, etc. At the end, I provide three possible reasons for the less popularity of jazz music:
+      1. The rise of other types of music which occupy the market. 

+      2. Recently, people prefer to express negative feelings more. Jazz music is not their first choice to listen.

+      3. People like to try out the new things. Using slangs make them feel cool.
